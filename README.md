# WHAT ARE THOSE BLUE SQUIGGLES?

Toni and Matteo share a lot of interests, and one of their passion is stdying the molecular structure of proteins.
Eache table is named after a protein!

## Table 1: Haemoglobin

Responsible for transporting oxygen in our blood, haemoglobin was the first protein Toni ever encountered. For her final high school project, Toni build by hand a 3D model of this protein!

## Table 2: Rhodopsin

Rhodopsin senses light. It is the main reason why we can see, and both Matteo and Toni have studied it in their work.

## Table 3: Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90)

HSP90 protectes organisms exposed to high temperatures. Again, coincidence, both Matteo and Toni have studied this class of proteins in their work.

## Table 4: Serum Albumin

Serum Albumin is called "the most romantic of the proteins" because, if you squint, you might notice that it kind of looks like a heart.

## Table 5: Lysozyme

Lysozyme is an enzyme providing innate protection against many pathogens. Every single person working in biophysics started their career looking at this protein!

## Table 6: Sonic Hedgehog

Hedgehog proteins are responsible for regulating the growth of an organism. Proteins of this class all carry names of hedgehogs (indian, brown, ...), but Sonic is clearly the one with the best name.
We picked it mostly because it is funny.
